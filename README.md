# Welcome to Scolvo Development Platform!
Develop enterprise mobile apps with the Scolvo Development Platform without ever leaving Visual Studio Code.

# Features
This extension was created to provide a GUI and full support for the  [`Scolvo Development Platform`](https://docs.scolvo.com/product/gettingStarted.html), a mobile-specific application development platform that empowers any developer to build employee-facing mobile applications for enterprise clients radically faster.
It also includes a language extension for the Scolvo language - a Javascript-like language powering the platform.

# Installation and licenses
